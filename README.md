# Swagger generated server

# Learning Project with Swagger and RESTful API

This project is a practical demonstration of how to use Swagger to document a RESTful API. The goal is to provide a clear and interactive API to facilitate understanding and usage by developers.

## Introduction

This project uses Swagger to document a RESTful API that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API is built using Node, and Swagger helps to visualize and interact with the API effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed:
- Node.js
- npm

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
